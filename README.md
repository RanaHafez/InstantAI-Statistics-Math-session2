# Task 1
Oversampling — Duplicating samples from
 the minority class

Undersampling — Deleting samples from the majority class.

Both oversampling and undersampling involve introducing a bias to select more samples from one class than from another, to compensate for an imbalance that is either already present in the data, or likely to develop if a purely random sample were taken

# Task 2
categorical data fall into two groups — ordinal and nominal
. Ordinal categorical data are non-numerical pieces of information with implied order — for example, survey responses on a scale from very dissatisfied to very satisfied. And nominal categorical data are non-numerical pieces of information without any inherent order — for example, colors or states

used simply for labeling variables, without any type of quantitative value.
Nominal data are those items which are distinguished by a simple naming system. They are data with no numeric value, such as profession. The nominal data just name a thing without applying it to an order related to other numbered items
Gender (Women, Men)
Religion (Muslin, Buddhist, Christian)
Hair color (Blonde, Brown, Brunette, Red, etc.)
Housing style (Ranch House, Modernist, Art Deco)
Marital status (Married, Single, Widowed)
Ethnicity (Hispanic, Asian)
Eye color (Blue, Green, Brown).

Ordinal data is data which is placed into some kind of order by their position on the scale

Ordinal data and variables are considered as “in between” categorical and quantitative variables. In other words, the ordinal data is categorical data for which the values are ordered.
The first, second and third person in a competition.
Education level with values of the elementary school education, high school graduate,
college graduate.
When a company asks a customer to rate the sales experience on a scale of 1-10.
When customers rank brands on the basis of their preferences.
Pay bands in a company, as indicated by A, B, C, and D.
Letter grades: A, B, C, and etc.
Economic status: low, medium and high.
When you perform a survey and ask respondents to express their level of satisfaction with the choice of those words: very satisfied, satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied, very dissatisfied.
When a respondent should put a value from 1 to 3 to a statement. Often the words “agree, neutral, disagree” are used.

# Task 3
 The distribution refers to how the data is spread out or clustered around certain values or ranges. 
There are two main types of data distribution in statistics: continuous and discrete
.Discrete variables take on countable and distinct values, whereas continuous variables can take on any value within a data set
Example on a discrete data:
The number of items you buy at the grocery store each week
 Example on a continous data:
Daily wind speed
...... 
Discrete Distribution Types
 
Binomial distribution
Poisson distribution
Hypergeometric distribution
Geometric distribution

Continuous Distribution Types
 
Normal Distribution
Lognormal distribution
F distribution
Chi-Square distribution
Exponential distribution
T Student distribution
Weibull Distribution
Non-normal distributions

# Task 4
Chi-square test- is used to compare two categorical variables. Calculating the Chi-Square statistic value and comparing it against a critical value from the Chi-Square distribution allows to assess whether the observed frequency are significantly different from the expected frequency
Z-test- is a statistical test used to determine whether two population means are different when the variances are known and the sample size is large. In z-test mean of the population is compared.The parameters used are population mean and population standard deviation. Z-test is used to validate a hypothesis that the sample drawn belongs to the same population

T-test-In t-test the mean of the two given samples are compared. A t-test is used when the population parameters (mean and standard deviation) are not known.

Paired T-Test-Tests for the difference between two variables from the same population( pre- and post test score). For example- In a training program performance score of the trainee before and after completion of the program
